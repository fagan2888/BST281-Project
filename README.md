# BST281-Project
This repository hosts files related to a group project for BST281 Genomic Data Analysis at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. This project is a collaboration between Matthew West, Hillary Tsang, and Anjali Jha.

Data preprocessing was performed using the notebook [`GDC_RNASeq_Notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/mwestt/BST281-Project/blob/master/bst281project_v5.Rmd).

The differential expression used to produce the final results was performed using code in [`bst281project_v5.Rmd`](https://github.com/mwestt/BST281-Project/blob/master/bst281project_v5.Rmd), though additional R and Python files are provided that were used for exploratory analysis using limma. Differential expression results used in the final project report can be found in [`noYDESeqresults_fin.csv`](https://github.com/mwestt/BST281-Project/blob/master/noYDESeqresults_fin.csv).
